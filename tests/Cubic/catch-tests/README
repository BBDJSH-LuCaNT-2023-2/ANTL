Using Belabas's program from the cubic-1.3 folder, one can generate index form 
polynomials for cubic fields. 

It's simple enough for C++ to read this output, but pari can't. 
The file belabas-to-pari.cpp is a program that will translate the output 
of Belabas's program to a list of polynomials that pari can easily read.

These are put in a file called "pari-formatted-polynomials.txt"

It is then straightforward to write gp program to process these polynomials and output the desired data.
