This directory should be used for the files generated by automake.
Automake builds should be done with the following commands from the top level directory
autoreconf -vi 
cd build
../configure
make

### Debugging if the commands above do not work

Compiling and linking arguments can be passed to make on the command line. For example
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" LDLIBS="-lntl -lgmp -lmpfi -lmpfr -lm -lpthread" CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -g -O0 -Wall -std=c++14" CXX="/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/9.3.0_1/bin/g++-9" make

## Installation
We have the following dependencies:
### Library Dependencies 
Updated June 2021

The following libraries are definitely needed.
The headers for them must be in a directory where your linker will find them.
m
ntl 
gmp 
mpc
mpfi 
mpfr 
pthread
When there is more than one package for one of these libraries it is probably safer to install the -devel 
(or -dev) version.

### Boost C++ Libraries Dependencies

### Automake/Autoconf Depenendencies
Updated June 2021

We depend on automake and autoconf with some additional macros.

On Fedora the dependencies can be installed with: sudo dnf install autoconf automake autoconf-archive
